Stop responding to grief and prevent it instead. GriefPreventionNG stops grief before it starts automatically without
any effort from administrators, and with very little (self-service) effort from players. Because GriefPreventionNG
teaches players for you, you won't have to publish a training manual or tutorial for players, or add explanatory signs
to your world.

This GriefPrevention fork is compatible with Paper and it's derivatives.
